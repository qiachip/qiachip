## Function description and setting method

**(1) Momentary mode; (2) Toggle mode; (3) Latching mode; (4) Reset function.**

**NOTE**

- When you use the first and second working modes, a remote control with at least two buttons is required.
- When you use the third working mode, a remote control with at least three buttons is required.
- When pairing a second remote, you don't need to press the button on the receiver 8 times again to reset it.
- Once the receiver and transmitter are paired and a working mode is selected, the receiver will retain this mode even if powered off and on again.
- The following working modes require the use of QIACHIP brand remote controls (transmitters) and controllers (receivers/wireless remote control switches). Compatibility with other brands is not guaranteed

### **(1) Momentary mode**

 In this mode: 

- Press and hold the remote control button (such as A), and the corresponding relay on the receiver is turned on.
- Release the remote control button (such as A), and the corresponding relay on the receiver will turn off.

### **How to set momentary mode**

**Step 1**

Click the learning button of the receiver once. The indicator light on the receiver turns off and the receiver enters the setting state.

**Step 2**

Press the button on the remote control (such as A) once. The indicator light on the receiver will flash and then turns off.

**Step 3**

After the indicator light goes out, press another button (such as B) on the same remote control. The indicator light on the receiver will flash and then turn on. The momentary mode is set successfully.

### **(2) Toggle mode**

In this mode: 

- Press the remote control button (such as A), and the corresponding relay on the receiver will turn on.
- Press the remote control button (such as A) again, and the corresponding relay on the receiver will turn off.

### **How to set toggle mode**

**Step 1**

Click the learning button of the receiver twice. The indicator light on the receiver turns off, and the receiver enters the setting state.

**Step 2**

Press the button on the remote control (such as A) once. The indicator light on the receiver will flash and then turns off.

**Step 3**

After the indicator light goes out, press another button (such as B) on the same remote control. The indicator light on the receiver will flash and then turn on. The toggle mode is set successfully. 

### **(3) Latching mode**

In this mode:

- Press the remote control button (such as A), and the corresponding receiver’s relay A is turned on.
- Press the remote control button (such as B), and the receiver’s relay B is turned on, and the receiver’s relay A is turned off.

### **How to set latching mode**

**Step 1** 

Click the learning button of the receiver three times. The indicator light on the receiver turns off, and the receiver enters the setting state. 

**Step 2**

Press the button on the remote control (such as A) once. The indicator light on the receiver will flash and then turns off.

**Step 3**

After the indicator light goes out, press another button (such as B) on the same remote control. The indicator light on the receiver will flash and then turn on. The latching mode is set successfully.
