## Function description and setting method

**(1) Momentary mode; (2) Toggle mode; (3) Latching mode; (4) Reset function.**

**NOTE**

- When you use the first and second working modes, a remote control with at least two buttons is required.
- When you use the third working mode, a remote control with at least three buttons is required.
- When pairing a second remote, you don't need to press the button on the receiver 8 times again to reset it.
